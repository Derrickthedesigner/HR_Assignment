HUMAN RESOURCE ANALYSIS.

40 Practice Questions in Data Science & Machine Learning.

Overview.

This project explores a comprehensive set of data science and machine learning techniques applied to a real-world Human Resources dataset. 

Through 40 questions, it covers the full analytics pipeline—exploratory data analysis (EDA) to business insights, data visualization, and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Objectives.

•	Perform  EDA to understand employee attributes and organizational trends.

•	Derive business insights from salary, engagement, recruitment, and performance data.

•	Create clear visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

•	Apply PCA and clustering to reduce dimensionality.

•	Strengthen proficiency in Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

Topics Covered.

Part A: Exploratory Data Analysis

•	Dataset structure, missing values, unique counts.

Part B: Business Analysis.

•	Salary comparisons by gender, marital status, race.

•	Recruitment source effectiveness.

Part C: Data Visualization.

•	Histograms, barplots, boxplots, heatmaps.

•	Stacked bar charts and scatterplots for performance metrics.

Part D: PCA & Clustering.

•	Feature standardization and PCA transformation.

•	KMeans clustering before and after PCA.

•	Use cases for PCA in HR analytics.

What I Learned.

•	How to structure a full data science workflow from raw data to insights.

•	The importance of data cleaning and preprocessing before modeling.

•	How visualizations enhance interpretability and stakeholder communication.

•	Practical applications of PCA in survey analysis and clustering.

•	How HR metrics like satisfaction, engagement, and absences can be quantitatively analyzed to support strategic decisions.
